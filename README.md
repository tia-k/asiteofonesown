# A (Short) Study in Sherlock
Hello! This is the repository that produces the website. There is not much in here apart from uncommented HTML and CSS files, which are uncommented because they are not really meant to be viewed! The main files you may want to view are the Jupyter Notebook files which can be found in the 'code' folder, and the figures used in the analysis, which can be found in the 'figures' folder. The website itself can be found here: https://tia-k.github.io/asiteofonesown/
