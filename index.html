                    <h2>A (Short) Study in Sherlock.</h2>
                    <p>The Sherlock Holmes mythology has remained persistent. From the original depiction of the detective on screen in 1900 to BBC's <i>Sherlock</i>, the series has remained prominent in cultural production. For this analysis, however, I would like to turn to where things started: the original Sherlock Holmes canon, written by Arthur Conan Doyle, consisting of four novels and five short-story collections. While I do not have access to the tools that could analyse the canon like a human close reading, I have attempted to use computational reading to test a hypothesis about the Sherlock Holmes series, which modern adaptations, in part, encouraged. In this reading, I intend to test whether, when writing the series, Arthur Conan Doyle settled quickly on a formula and style of writing that remained consistent throughout the entire series. To do this, I will begin with one of the simplest measures to calculate computationally: the texts' type-token ratios.</p>
                    <h3>Type-Token Ratio</h3>
                    <p>In layperson's terms, the type-token ratio (TTR) of a text is the ratio of unique words to total words. In practice, it can act as a rough measure for the level of lexical variation in a text. Here, it has been calculated as a value between one and zero, with one being the most possible lexical variation and zero being the lowest possible lexical variation. With that in mind, this is the rough progression of lexical variation across the Sherlock Holmes series. </p>

                    <p>This visualisation alone reveals a very varied picture with little to infer. However, we get a different picture when we separate the novels and the short story collections.</p>

                    <p>These visualisations are more sensical. Beginning with the novels, we see a downward trend from a higher TTR to a lower TTR, suggesting that lexical variation decreased as the series progressed. This may imply that, as the series developed, Doyle developed a stronger idea of the series' semantic field and, thus, used less varied language. While this does not support our hypothesis entirely, it does seem to affirm that Doyle created a formula that he then proceeded to use. The high TTR of the earliest novels can be viewed as Doyle experimenting, whereas the lower TTR of the final two novels can be seen as Doyle honing down on the formula for a Holmes novel.
                        The short stories collections also have a trend but in the opposite direction. Their TTR increases as time progresses, suggesting that Doyle's lexical variation increases over the series. This seems to suggest the inverse of the graph representing the novels. Doyle seems to experiment with the semantic field of the series over time. However, when we look closely at both graphs, we see the TTR (on average) converge around 1915, when the last Holmes novel was published. Thus, while it may seem that the short story collections become more experimental as a whole, they seem to converge in terms of lexical variation as Doyle got further into writing the series, suggesting that Doyle's level of experimentation was something he was able to apply equally to both the short stories and the novels when he had more experience with the series. Thus, our hypothesis seems to be relatively congruent with the TTR values for the texts.
