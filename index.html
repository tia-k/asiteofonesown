                    <h2>A (Short) Study in Sherlock.</h2>
                    <p>The Sherlock Holmes mythology has remained persistent. From the original depiction of the detective on screen in 1900 to BBC's <i>Sherlock</i>, the series has remained prominent in cultural production. For this analysis, however, I would like to turn to where things started: the original Sherlock Holmes canon, written by Arthur Conan Doyle, consisting of four novels and five short-story collections. While I do not have access to the tools that could analyse the canon like a human close reading, I have attempted to use computational reading to test a hypothesis about the Sherlock Holmes series, which modern adaptations, in part, encouraged. In this reading, I intend to test whether, when writing the series, Arthur Conan Doyle settled quickly on a formula and style of writing that remained consistent throughout the entire series. To do this, I will begin with one of the simplest measures to calculate computationally: the texts' type-token ratios.</p>
                    <h3>Type-Token Ratio</h3>
                    <p>In layperson's terms, the type-token ratio (TTR) of a text is the ratio of unique words to total words. In practice, it can act as a rough measure for the level of lexical variation in a text. Here, it has been calculated as a value between one and zero, with one being the most possible lexical variation and zero being the lowest possible lexical variation. With that in mind, this is the rough progression of lexical variation across the Sherlock Holmes series. </p>

                    <p>This visualisation alone reveals a very varied picture with little to infer. However, we get a different picture when we separate the novels and the short story collections.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>These visualisations are more sensical. Beginning with the novels, we see a downward trend from a higher TTR to a lower TTR, suggesting that lexical variation decreased as the series progressed. This may imply that, as the series developed, Doyle developed a stronger idea of the series' semantic field and, thus, used less varied language. While this does not support our hypothesis entirely, it does seem to affirm that Doyle created a formula that he then proceeded to use. The high TTR of the earliest novels can be viewed as Doyle experimenting, whereas the lower TTR of the final two novels can be seen as Doyle honing down on the formula for a Holmes novel.</p>
                    <p>The short stories collections also have a trend but in the opposite direction. Their TTR increases as time progresses, suggesting that Doyle's lexical variation increases over the series. This seems to suggest the inverse of the graph representing the novels. Doyle seems to experiment with the semantic field of the series over time. However, when we look closely at both graphs, we see the TTR (on average) converge around 1915, when the last Holmes novel was published. Thus, while it may seem that the short story collections become more experimental as a whole, they seem to converge in terms of lexical variation as Doyle got further into writing the series, suggesting that Doyle's level of experimentation was something he was able to apply equally to both the short stories and the novels when he had more experience with the series. Thus, our hypothesis seems to be relatively congruent with the TTR values for the texts.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Another set of data points about the texts that seems to agree with our hypothesis is the development of sentiment (in the sense of positive versus negative language) across the texts or, more specifically, novels. Due to the sheer amount of them, I have been unable to run sentiment analysis on the short stories. I elected not to do so for the collected short stories, as, unlike the novels, they do not intend to form one coherent narrative.</p>
                    <p>From the novels alone, however, we get the sense that Doyle developed, to some degree, a formula of sentiment.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In these graphs, where sentiment (on the Y-axis) of plus one is the most positive and minus one is the most negative and is calculated on average for each five per cent of each novel, we see a move, on-trend, from positive to negative across all of the texts except from The Sign of the Four. The consistency of this trend, except for in the earlier novels, recreates what we saw in the texts' TTR values: the early series was less consistent, whereas the later series was more consistent. While the shape of sentiment varies, the overall trend is similar. Thus, we may conclude that Doyle developed a formula of moving from positive to negative language (at least, in our modern views of the English language) after writing the first two novels.</p>
                    <h3>Networks</h3>
                    <p>I was able to look at the short stories more closely by manually creating networks, where each direct, on-page exchange of words between characters was recorded as a connection. In doing so for the first short story in the first and last collections, a striking similarity between the early and late series emerged.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="figures/fig11.png" title="A network of 'The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone' (1921) visualised in Palladio, not including Sherlock Holmes." height="386" width="500"/>

                    </figure>
                    <p>In both network visualisations, we see the removal of the series' central detective detracting immensely from the network. This is obvious in 'Bohemia', where Holmes' removal splits the network into three disconnected sections. However, even in 'Mazarin Stone', written thirty years later, the removal of Holmes makes the network substantially barer; it removes the story's central villain, Count Sylvius. That Holmes' removal fractures the networks of both texts suggests that from the early short stories to the late short stories, Holmes remained essential for joining characters. It is not only the case that without Holmes, there is no plot; without Holmes, characters are never even linked on the page or never appear as characters.<br></p>
                    <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
                    <p>To return to viewing both the novels and short stories at once, we will move on to natural language processing, used here to define parts of speech. While I do not have time to examine closely how every part of speech was used across the series, I would like to present one visualisation that was striking from its generation.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="figures/fig12.png" title="A grouped bar chart displaying the distribution of the word types across the texts in the Sherlock Holmes series." height="324" width="700"/>
                        <figcaption>Figure 12. A grouped bar chart displaying the distribution of the word types across the texts in the Sherlock Holmes series.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>In my computational processing, I only took adjectives, nouns, pronouns and verbs into account, meaning the percentage on the Y-axis here refers to what proportion each part of speech was across the data collected. However, as this makes this data in proportion with itself, the similarity of the distribution for each text in the series strongly suggests that Doyle used these four parts of language in similar quantities throughout the series. This visualisation suggests that from the series' very start, Doyle focused on the more objective language of nouns, pronouns, and verbs rather than the more subjective language of adjectives and consistently used these in the same relative proportions. We may infer, then, that Doyle likely maintained a rigid standard for using parts of language throughout the whole series.<br></p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>While it would be overstating the statistical significance of the data gathered here to say it has truly gathered anything conclusive about the Sherlock Holmes series, it provides some suggestions on how the series changed as it progressed. It suggests that the titular detective, at least in the short stories, remained structurally central and that the language's relative proportion of nouns, pronouns and verbs to adjectives remained consistent across its duration. While some elements of the series changed according to the measures presented, these progressions, such as the reducing lexical variation in novels and progression to novels consistently moving from positive to negative language, can be seen as reflections of Doyle moving from experimenting in the early series to gaining a stronger idea of what the typical Holmes story looks like in the later texts. Therefore, the data we have here, at least partly, implies that the hypothesis brought to the text earlier may be correct. The Sherlock Holmes series seems to maintain specific standards across its duration, and when it varies, it occurs at the beginning of the series, where we may expect more variation. A successful series, this may suggest, does not necessarily require vast experimentation: once a good formula is found, a good formula works.</p>
